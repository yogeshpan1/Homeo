      <h1>Our Story: How Homeo Began</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        Homeo was built to bring Nepali people closer and give foreign visitors a chance to experience Nepal like locals. Inspired by AirBnB but rooted in Nepali culture, Homeo is for everyone seeking authentic stays.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Idea</h2>
    <p>
      In 2022, a group of friends traveling across Nepal noticed that international platforms didn’t capture the real local experience. Most listings were missing or not suitable for Nepali travelers and foreigners seeking authentic cultural stays. That’s how Homeo was born.
    </p>

    <img src="../AIRBNB-VCS-PROJECT/images/Blog2.jpg" alt="Founders brainstorming the initial concept">

    <h2>Building for Nepal — and the World</h2>
    <p>
      Homeo was designed to make listing homes simple for anyone in Nepal. Village homestays, city apartments, and countryside lodges are all accessible from one platform. Nepali travelers get affordable stays, and foreigners get the chance to experience real homes, real food, and real people.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenges Along the Way</h2>
    <p>
      Building a platform in Nepal had challenges like connectivity issues and payment integration. With dedication and feedback, Homeo became stronger and suited for both locals and international travelers.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      Homeo connects travelers with real experiences, helps families earn from hosting, and showcases Nepali hospitality. Whether Nepali or foreign, Homeo helps everyone feel at home in Nepal.
    </p>

    <p>
      The story of Homeo is still being written. With every new host and traveler, we build a community that belongs to Nepal and welcomes the world.
